# Remote Instrumentation Interactive Guide

Welcome to the remote instrumentation interactive guide! This guide mostly serves as a collection of resources, notes, and examples to help you learn about remote instrumentation with a focus on the [QCoDeS python library](http://microsoft.github.io/Qcodes/). This guide is primarily intended for beginners in the field.   

Feel free to update and contribute to the docs by adding your own notes, links and/or example scripts. The QCoDeS library, in particular, is undergoing rapid development so some scripts may be outdated by the time of reading.
