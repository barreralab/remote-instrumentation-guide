# Remote Instrumentation Interactive Guide

Welcome to the remote instrumentation interactive guide! This guide serves as a collection of resources, notes, and examples to help you learn about remote instrumentation with a focus on the [QCoDeS python library](http://microsoft.github.io/Qcodes/). This guide is primarily intended for people who are just getting started with the subject.

Feel free to update and contribute to the guide by adding your own notes, links, and/or example scripts. The QCoDeS library, in particular, is undergoing rapid development so some scripts may be outdated by the time of reading. See [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/barreralab/remote-instrumentation-guide/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more info.

## How to use 
Browse at your own leisure. The sections are organized so that they build off each other but you can search for specific information using the search bar.

The guide will often link to example scripts which are housed in the github source [repository](https://github.com/barreralab/remote-instrumentation-guide). To run these scripts on your own device, you will need both the relevant physical instruments and software drivers. All scripts will require a working VISA installation which the guide discusses in the [Intro](./intro.md#visa-and-scpi). Other dependencies such as pyvisa, qcodes, and additional drivers will be specified in the scripts themselves and in the corresponding sections of the docs. 
Some examples may not be discussed in the guide, so be sure to check out the repo itself.
